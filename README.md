# CRUD-POLL-SERVER

This is the page that works with my CRUD application server.
Right now we have the option to CREATE, READ and DELETE.

I used NodeJS and MYSQL and extensions: nodemon, body-parser, cors, dotenv, express, mysql.

To server start, just open a terminal and write: npm start. The port i'm using is 3002.
